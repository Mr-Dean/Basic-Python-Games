# Basic-Python-Games

I made these little games to learn basic syntax and control flow in Python.

## How To Run Games

1. Open your Terminal (Mac).
2. Type "python" then the game file name.

Instead of typing the file name you can just copy and paste the command

### Guess The Number Game:

Copy & paste into terminal: **python Guess_The_Number_Game.py**

### Magic 8 Ball:

Copy & paste into terminal: **python Magic_8_Ball.py**
