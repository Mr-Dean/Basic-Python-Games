# Basic-Python-Games

I made these little games to learn basic syntac and control flow in Python.

## How To Run Games

1. Open your Terminal (Mac).
2. Type "python <game file>.

Instead of typing the file name you can just copy and paste the command:

### Guess The Number Game:

python Guess_The_Number_Game.py

### Magic 8 Ball:

python Magic_8_Ball.py
